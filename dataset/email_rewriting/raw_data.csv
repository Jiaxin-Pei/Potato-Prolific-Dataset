We have actually downsized the group since the departure of Robert Greer and Anna Briggs. 
I also identified replacement for the one Associate rotating out in the summer. 
In terms of Analysts, we have two rotating out in the summer, but we really prefer analysts with a year of experience and will take our chances identifying and hiring them.
Since summer is not likely to be a really busy time for us this year, I don’t think we need summer A/A’s.

I'm pleased to share that we have updated our Remedy system to prioritize support for our home office workers. Additionally, we have made it a priority to assign any requests to Glenn or Robert whenever possible. Speaking of which, I'm happy to report that Glenn was able to successfully install a modem in Shirley's machine.

However, we are still experiencing some issues with the CITRIX Server and VPN access. Our solution center team believes that the problem may be on the Road Runner side, and Jean McFarland is currently working on a resolution. Despite this challenge, I am glad to report that everyone has been able to work from home with little to no issues.

Thank you for your understanding and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

for your benefit make sure you get someone to go back and look closely at relative storage levels and prices levels for all btus in 1998
relationahips as you recall get bizarre on the lower end of the spectrum...it's a good couple of graphs to keep around
1- all stocks as a% full chart
2-btus equi chart
1vs2
1vs diffs in #2
If i could access this info i'd send it...but enron systems being what they are it takes hours to connnect to houston drive","Hi there,

I wanted to share some information with you regarding recent market trends. On Friday, Brent experienced a significant decline and I believe this may be a good time to consider selling. In case it's helpful, I suggest looking into relative storage levels and price levels for all BTUs in 1998. Relationships on the lower end of the spectrum can be a bit unusual, so I recommend keeping a couple of graphs handy: one chart showing all stocks as a percentage of full capacity, and another displaying BTU equivalents. It might also be useful to compare the two graphs and examine any differences.

I apologize that I don't have this information readily available to send over. Unfortunately, connecting to the Houston drive through Enron systems can be quite time-consuming. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

- Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9. Can you let me know whether this is OK with you?

I would like to add electric index descriptions to the database. Gas Daily Publication would provide more insight, page 3 shows indices that I would like used. If we insert the electronic index where we currently have the Gas Daily index survey language it will be with the GD swaps in the database. The following points are what I am hoping to have the GD swaps performed:  El Paso Permian, El Paso, non-bonded, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal Gas, and large packages. Adding ""electronic"" to the product title will make it easy to differentiate between the two. Please let me know if they are any questions.

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.
Thanks,
Kim","Good morning J.,

I'm not sure how I feel about this. They want to meet me on Friday in San Diego. We would be discussing a potential deal on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak Power Plants. We were short-listed, but I'm not sure if it is worth the risk. A decision needs to be made quickly. What are your thoughts?

I agree that we should reduce the number of ""names"" from a global standpoint now while we can.  
The routing portion of the workspace seems to work well, I agree, but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it.

We'll see...I'll hit it again next week.

Thanks for all of your work documenting issues that can be improved with the project. Based on your comments, I have the following notes:

1) We should reduce the number of names from a global standpoint
