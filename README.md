# POPQUORN: the Potato-Prolific dataset for Question- Answering, Offensiveness, text Rewriting and politeness rating with demographic Nuance

POPQUORN is a collaboration effort of [potato](https://github.com/davidjurgens/potato) and [prolific](https://www.prolific.co) to create a open-source dataset with both individual annotations and annotator's backgrounds.
POPQUORN contains 45,000 annotations from 1484 annotators drawing from a US-population representative sample (for age, sex and race). This github repo contains raw annotations as well as the detailed demographic information. POPQUORN is released with the following paper:
